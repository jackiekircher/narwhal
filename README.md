##Ascii Ascii Narwhal

Back in 2010 I workd on [Ascii Ascii Revolution](https://github.com/jackiekircher/AsciiAsciiRevolution) for OSGCC 4.
Our themes were corn and narwhals, and we made a humble Dance Dance Revolution clone in D with nCurses. There is a
quick video of it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fil-LXC9CRA).

Unfortunately, that little narwhal only got to dance for a select audience. Now he shall dance for all time.
